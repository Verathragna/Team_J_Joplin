# Multi-factor authentication

You can now enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to your Joplin Account. MFA enhances your account security by requiring more than just a password to log in. 

If you can't generate your authentication code because you have lost access to your smartphone, for example, you will need to use one of the recovery codes to log in.

## Recovery Codes

When you enable MFA, Joplin Cloud will show you a list of codes, that you should save in somewhere safe. Each code can only be used once, but you can generate new codes, if necessary, from your profile page.

## What do I need?

To be able to enable MFA you will need a smartphone with an app that can store your MFA credential. Some third-party alternatives are: [Authy](https://authy.com/download/), [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [Microsoft Authenticator App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en), or any password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/).
