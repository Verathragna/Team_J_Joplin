# Multi-factor authentication

You can now enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to your Joplin Account. MFA enhances your account security by requiring more than just a password to log in. 

If you can't generate your authentication code because you have lost access to your smartphone, for example, you will need to use one of the recovery codes to log in.

## Recovery Codes

When you enable MFA, Joplin Cloud will show you a list of codes, that you should save in somewhere safe. Each code can only be used once, but you can generate new codes, if necessary, from your profile page.

## How to enable MFA

- [Access your profile](https://joplincloud.com/users/me)
- Find the *Multi-factor authentication* section
- Click the link to *Enable Multi-Factor Authentication*
- Follow the instructions shown in the page

If successful you should see a notification and a new page with your recovery codes, **remember to save them**.

## How to disable MFA

- [Access your profile](https://joplincloud.com/users/me)
- Find the *Multi-factor authentication* section
- Click the link to *I want to disable it*
- Finish by entering your password

## I forgot to copy my recovery codes, how do I find them?

- [Access your profile](https://joplincloud.com/users/me)
- Find the *Multi-factor authentication* section
- Click the link to *Recovery Codes*
- Follow the instructions shown in the page

> You will only be able to see your recovery codes if you have MFA enabled

## How do I generate new recovery codes?

- [Access your profile](https://joplincloud.com/users/me)
- Find the *Multi-factor authentication* section
- Click the link to *Recovery Codes*
- After finishing the process you should see a list of your recovery codes and a button at the bottom to generate new codes

> The new codes will invalidate the old ones, so remember to save it.

## How to log in with my recovery code

- When prompted for a authentication code click in the link *Use a recovery code* bellow the input field
