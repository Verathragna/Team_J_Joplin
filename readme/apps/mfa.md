# Multi-factor authentication

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), also known as Two Factor Authentication (2FA),  enhances your account security by requiring more than just a password to log in.

## How to disable MFA

## Recovery codes

When you enable MFA, Joplin Cloud will show you a list of codes, that you should save in somewhere safe. Each code can only be used once, but you can generate new codes, if necessary, from your profile page.

If you can't generate your authentication code because you have lost access to your smartphone, for example, you will need to use one of the recovery codes to log in.
