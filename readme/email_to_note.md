# Email to note

You can save your emails in Joplin Cloud by forwarding your emails to your Inbox Email address. The content of the email and its attachments will be saved in a note with the name of the email inside a notebook called Inbox. 

All notes created this way will use, like any other note, your Joplin Cloud storage capacity.

This feature is available for Pro and Teams members.
