# Email to note

With Joplin Cloud you can forward or send emails to your Inbox Email address and its content and the attached files end up in your "Inbox" notebook.

All emails forwarded to your Inbox Email will use your Joplin Storage, so it will respect the limit that your account has.

## How to get your Inbox Email

To see your Inbox Email in the desktop and mobile application you need to synchronize with Joplin Cloud.
