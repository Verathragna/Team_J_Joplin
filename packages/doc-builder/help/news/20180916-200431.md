# Note properties in desktop application

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/news/20180916-200431_0.png)

The new desktop version of Joplin for Windows, macOS and Linux features a new dialog box to view and edit the note properties, such as the updated date, created date, source URL or even location. It's a small change but it can be useful. This dialog can be accessed by clicking on the Information icon in the toolbar.

As usual this release also includes various bug fixes and improvements. More information on the changelog: [https://joplin.cozic.net/changelog/](https://joplin.cozic.net/changelog/)
